💡 Key Insights from DemoFinding #1: Truth Distortion is Non-Partisan
Both liberal and conservative sources show patterns of selective evidence presentation. High-quality analysis exists across the spectrum.Finding #2: Neutral ≠ Always Better
Some neutral sources score lower than partisan sources when the partisan source has superior methodology and evidence.Finding #3: Confidence Scale Matters
The -10 to +10 scale reveals nuances that binary fact-checking misses. Most articles fall in the +5 to +8 range - credible but with acknowledged limitations.Finding #4: Epistemic Integrity is Critical
