VERITAS Interactive DemoTruth Verification Through Expert AnalysisAn interactive demonstration of the VERITAS framework for transparent, expert-driven information verification across the political spectrum.🎯 OverviewVERITAS (Verification through Expert Review & Integrity in Truth Assessment System) is an information verification platform that uses a nuanced confidence scale (-10 to +10) rather than binary "true/false" judgments. This demo showcases real assessments across four controversial topics, demonstrating how VERITAS evaluates sources from across the political spectrum.Live Demo: https://veritastruth.net/VERITAS_Web_Package/VERITAS_Interactive_Demo_Web.html✨ FeaturesInteractive Assessment Browser

In the prototype demo of the process 4 Topics were used to test the
environment and process: Election Fraud, Immigration, National Debt, Gender Identity
12 Articles Assessed: 3 articles per topic from diverse sources

In the demo these is a 4-Step User Flow:

Article card with metadata and confidence rating

VERITAS reading overview (key findings)
Complete assessment with transparent methodology

Confidence Scoring System

-10 to +10 Scale: Captures nuance from "confidently false" to "confidently true"
Color-Coded Ratings: Visual indicators for quick assessment
Transparent Reasoning: Every rating explained with methodology
Epistemic Humility: "Cannot Determine" is a valued response

In order to test the process even further, we now have a Live Assessment tool
available that allows users to enter a claim or the URL of an article and 
apply the VERITAS methodology to ascertain the level of truth and deception
present in the source as well as the integrity of the question itself which
examines implicit biases, tribalism and deceptions built into the question
or article's structure.
