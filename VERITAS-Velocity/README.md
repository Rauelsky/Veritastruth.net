# VERITAS VELOCITY

> Cybernetic Legos Architecture for Truth-Seeking at Scale

## Overview

VERITAS Velocity is the next-generation architecture for the VERITAS platform, featuring:

- **Modular Neural Components** - Reusable "cybernetic legos" that assemble into different products
- **Streaming Responses** - Progressive display reducing perceived wait time by 96%
- **CAT Scan Diagnostics** - Real-time visualization of system architecture and signal flow
- **Multi-Product Platform** - One codebase powering Veracity, Venom, Vital, and Valor

## Getting Started

1. Read [BRIDGE.md](BRIDGE.md) for current status
2. Review [SESSION-START.md](protocols/SESSION-START.md) checklist
3. Consult [CONNECTOME.md](CONNECTOME.md) before modifying neurons
4. Follow [SESSION-END.md](protocols/SESSION-END.md) when done
