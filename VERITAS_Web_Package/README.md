## 🖖 Notes

This web package was created to preserve all the hard work that went into making the VERITAS demo functional with locally-saved articles. By using relative paths, we ensure the demo works anywhere without depending on external links that might break or get blocked.

**Original OneDrive version preserved** - This is a separate web-deployment version that maintains identical functionality while being portable and shareable.

Live long and prosper! 🖖
