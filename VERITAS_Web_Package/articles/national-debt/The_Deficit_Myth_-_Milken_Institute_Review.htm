<p style="padding-top: 10px;">If you think Modern Monetary Theory is a 
rationale for ignoring federal budget deficits and spending whatever’s 
necessary to fund an ambitious progressive agenda — everything from 
tuition-free college to Medicare-for-All — you’re correct, in part. It’s
 certainly been used that way by the political left, much as supply-side
 economics has been used by the right to justify tax cuts for the one 
percent. But as Stephanie Kelton, an economics professor at the State 
University of New York at Stony Brook and the most visible (and 
persuasive) advocate of MMT, makes strikingly clear in <em>The Deficit Myth: Modern Monetary Theory and the Birth of the People’s Economy</em>,
 much of what underpins the theory is widely accepted by mainstream 
economists — if not mainstream politicians and the public. Indeed, while
 the terminology is different, one can make the case that MMT builds on 
fundamental precepts of Keynesian economics seasoned with a dash of 
Milton Friedman’s provocations. Read this excerpt with an open mind, and
 you may just begin to doubt the “common sense” of fiscal prudence.</p><p>— <em>Peter Passell</em></p><p>illustrations by <span class="bio">michal dziekan</span></p><p>Published January 24, 2021</p><div class="redLine">&nbsp;</div>

      <p class="dropcap opening">When I arrived in Washington in 2015, I
 was the only staffer on the U.S. Senate Budget Committee who looked at 
the world through the lens of a currency issuer. I knew the federal 
government wasn’t like a household or a private business. I knew Uncle 
Sam could never run out of money. I knew that inflation, rather than 
insolvency, was the relevant punishment for overspending. I also knew I 
was alone in this thinking.</p><p>Everyone else fell into one of two 
camps: deficit hawks or deficit doves. While Washington insiders 
depicted them as polar opposites, I saw them as birds of a feather. Both
 considered the long-term fiscal outlook a problem that needed to be 
fixed. Most Republicans wanted to slash entitlements, while most 
Democrats wanted to raise taxes. Different paths to the same 
destination.</p>

      <p>As word spread that I would be heading to the nation’s capital 
to advise the Democrats, journalists fired off articles with headlines 
like “Sanders Hires Deficit Owl.” I had coined that term in 2010, as a 
way to distinguish the views held by modern monetary theory (MMT) 
economists like me from those of the more deficit-anxious birds. Most of
 the senators on the committee had never heard of MMT. When I met with 
the members of the committee for the first time, no one was rude, but I 
could sense that there was reticence about expanding the deficit aviary.</p><p>I
 looked for ways to help the committee without reinforcing myths and 
misunderstandings about our nation’s finances. One of the most 
eye-opening things I learned came from a game I would play with members 
of the committee (or their staffers). I’d start by asking them to 
imagine that they had discovered a magic wand with the power to 
eliminate the entire national debt with one flick of the wrist. Then I’d
 ask, “Would you wave the wand?” Without hesitation, they all wanted the
 debt gone. Then, I’d ask a seemingly different question: “Suppose that 
wand had the power to rid the world of U.S. Treasuries. Would you wave 
it?” The question drew puzzled looks. Eventually, everyone would decide 
against waving the wand.</p><p>They loved U.S. Treasuries, as long as 
they thought of them as financial assets held by the private sector. But
 they hated the very same securities when they considered them 
obligations of the federal government.</p><p>Eventually, I’d point out 
that I had asked two versions of the same question. Some of them told me
 they understood that waving the wand entailed eliminating the entire 
U.S. Treasury market, but they wanted the debt wiped out anyway, because
 it scares voters.</p>

 course voters are terrified! It’s virtually impossible to get through 
the workweek without encountering some form of hysteria over fiscal 
deficits and the national debt. A debt clock towers over pedestrians on 
West 43rd Street in New York City, delivering the daunting numbers in 
real time. Social media circulates breaking news alerts to report the 
latest dire projections from the Congressional Budget Office.</p>

      <p>The truth is, we’re fine. The debt clock simply displays a 
historical record of how many dollars the federal government has added 
to people’s pockets without subtracting (taxing) them away. Those 
dollars are being saved in the form of U.S. Treasuries. If you’re lucky 
enough to own some, congratulations! They’re part of your wealth. While 
others may refer to it as a debt clock, it’s really a U.S. dollar 
savings clock. But you won’t hear that from anyone in Congress. Think 
about what would happen if a member of Congress returned to his or her 
district and tried to convince a roomful of panicked constituents that 
everything they deeply fear about our ballooning national debt is really
 a big nothing- burger.</p>

      <p>Even if their own thinking wasn’t so broken, there are reasons 
members of Congress might not want the rest of us to see the so called 
debt for what it really is.</p><p>I remember being struck by this during
 a meeting with members of the Budget Committee. The Congressional 
Budget Office had projected that the fiscal deficit would stand at $1.1 
trillion and the gross federal debt would reach $27.3 trillion in 2025. 
Mike Enzi, the committee’s chairman, suggested that the CBO be required 
to write the numbers out in long form: $1,100,000,000,000 and 
$27,300,000,000,000.</p><p>Once politicians like Senator Enzi succeed in
 making us anxious about the sheer size of this thing we label debt, 
they can weaponize that fear in a number of ways. By persuading voters 
that something must be done about these big scary numbers, politicians 
can push for cuts to popular programs like Social Security and Medicare.
 People will fight tooth and nail to protect them. Unless, of course, 
they can be convinced that there is no alternative. MMT shows that we 
don’t need to fix the debt. We need to fix our thinking.</p>

      <h6 style="padding-top: 8px;">China, Greece and Bernie Madoff</h6><p>I
 can read the latest CBO report and not panic over the projected 
increase in the national debt. I don’t agonize over “my share” of the 
national debt, and I never worry about the U.S. ending up like Greece. I
 don’t fret over the possibility that China might one day shut off the 
spigot and starve the U.S. of the dollars we need to pay our bills. 
Heck, I don’t even think we should be referring to the sale of U.S. 
Treasuries as borrowing, or labeling the securities themselves as the 
national debt. So, let’s try to fix our thinking.</p><p>It was at a 
campaign stop in Fargo, North Dakota where Obama told a small crowd that
 America was relying on “a credit card from the Bank of China.” His 
choice of words was important because it taps into two of our basic 
anxieties. For one thing, there’s the fear of relying on borrowed money 
to pay the bills. Hearing that our country is running up trillions of 
dollars in credit card debt is enough to make anyone worry. Learning 
that we owe that money to a foreign nation — an adversary even – only 
heightens the anxiety.</p>

      <p>It’s not that we don’t have anything to worry about when it 
comes to our international trading partners. But relying on China to pay
 our bills isn’t one of them. To see why, let’s take a step back and 
think about how China (and other foreign countries) end up holding U.S. 
government bonds.</p><p>What happens first is that China decides it 
wants to sell some of what it produces to buyers outside China. The U.S.
 does that, too, but America exports less than it imports. In 2018, the 
U.S. exported $120 billion in U.S. manufactured goods to China, while 
China shipped $540 billion of its products to the U.S. The difference 
gave China a $420 billion merchandise trade surplus. Americans paid for 
those goods with U.S. dollars, and those payments were credited to 
China’s account at the Federal Reserve.</p><p>Like any other holder of 
U.S. dollars, China has the option to sit on those dollars or use them 
to buy something else. Uncle Sam doesn’t pay interest on the dollars 
that China keeps in its checking account at the Fed, so China usually 
prefers to move them into what is effectively a savings account at the 
Fed. It does this by purchasing U.S. Treasuries. It’s still just sitting
 on its U.S. dollars, but now China is holding what I call “yellow” 
dollars instead of green ones.</p><p>The dollars don’t originate from 
China. They’re coming from the United States. We’re not really borrowing
 from China so much as we’re supplying China with dollars and then 
allowing those dollars to be transformed into U.S. Treasury securities. 
Terms like borrowing are misleading. So is labeling those securities the
 national debt. There is no real debt obligation.</p><p>Although China 
is the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasuries, it owned less than 7 
percent of the publicly held total at the time of this writing. Still, 
some people worry that this gives China enormous leverage over the U.S. 
because China could decide to sell off its holdings. The worry is that 
Uncle Sam could lose access to affordable financing if China refuses to 
keep buying Treasuries.</p>

      <p>There are a number of problems with this thinking. For one 
thing, China can’t avoid holding dollar assets without wiping out its 
trade surplus with the United States. That’s not something China wants 
to do, since shrinking its exports to the U.S. would slow its economic 
growth. And even if it does decide to hold fewer U.S. Treasuries, this 
won’t leave Uncle Sam strapped for cash.</p><p>Remember, the U.S. is a currency issuer, which means it can never run out of dollars.</p><p>Even
 though it can’t happen to the United States, it is possible for a 
country to lose access to affordable financing. That’s what happened to 
Greece in 2010. But that’s because Greece undermined its monetary 
sovereignty by abandoning the drachma in favor of the euro in 2001. All 
of the Greek government’s existing debt was redenominated into euros, a 
currency that the Greek government could not issue. Lending to Greece 
was now a lot like lending to an individual U.S. state — say Georgia or 
Illinois.</p><p>As the 2008 financial crisis spread through Europe, tax 
revenues fell off a cliff. At the same time, the Greek government was 
making larger payments to support the ailing economy. That pushed 
Greece’s budget deficit to more than 15 percent of its GDP in 2009.</p><p>To
 cover those deficits, Greece had to borrow. The problem was that 
lenders weren’t willing to buy Greek government bonds unless they got a 
substantial premium for the obvious risk they were taking in lending 
billions of euros to a borrower who might have trouble paying it back. 
From 2009 to 2012, the interest rate on ten-year Greek government bonds 
rose from less than 6 percent to more than 35 percent!</p><p>Compare 
that with what happened in currency-issuing countries like the U.S. and 
the UK. Their fiscal deficits more than tripled from 2007 to 2009. And 
yet the average interest rate paid on ten-year government bonds fell 
from 3.3 percent to 1.8 percent in the U.S. and from 5 percent to 3.6 
percent in the UK. That’s because both countries have a central bank 
that acts on behalf of the government as a monopoly supplier of the 
currency.</p>

      <p>Still, isn’t there some limit? Surely the U.S. debt can’t go on
 rising forever. To some people, finding new investors to purchase a 
never-ending mountain of government debt can start to look like a 
fraudulent pyramid scheme. The kind run by the notorious huckster Bernie
 Madoff. It isn’t.</p><p>Madoff was defrauding investors. The U.S. Treasury is not.</p><p>The
 U.S. could not end up like Greece, desiring to make scheduled payments 
to bondholders but lacking the authority to instruct its central bank to
 clear the payments. That’s because the federal government can always 
meet its obligation to turn those yellow dollars back into green 
dollars. All it has to do is change the relevant numbers on the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet.</p><p>Since our lawmakers have not yet had the 
benefit of MMT’s insights, they view debt service as a growing financial
 burden on the federal government. In truth, paying interest on 
government bonds is no more difficult than processing any other payment.
 To pay the interest, the Federal Reserve simply credits the appropriate
 bank account.</p><p>Right now, lawmakers look at rising interest 
expenditure the way we might look at a rising cable bill — it means less
 money to spend on everything else. So, when the CBO says that the 
federal government is on track to “spend more on interest payments than 
the entire discretionary budget … by 2046,” many lawmakers begin to 
panic. They think it shrinks the amount of money that’s left over, 
forcing them to spend less on other priorities. That’s just not true. 
There is, however, only so much room in the economy to safely absorb 
higher spending. That’s the constraint Congress needs to worry about.</p><p>The
 limit is our economy’s capacity to absorb that additional spending 
without pushing inflation higher. Every dollar that is paid in the form 
of interest becomes income to bondholders. If a high percentage of 
interest income was spent back into the economy, it could potentially 
push aggregate spending above potential, fueling some inflationary 
pressure. Even if bondholders aren’t spending enough of their interest 
income to fuel ordinary price inflation, they might still fuel asset 
price inflation by using their interest income to bid up the prices of 
commodities, real estate, stocks and so on.</p>

      <h6 style="padding-top: 8px;">We Could Pay It off Tomorrow</h6><p>In April 2016, <em>Time</em>
 magazine devoted its cover to the U.S. national debt. It began, “Dear 
Reader, You Owe $42,998.12. That’s what every American man, woman and 
child would need to pay to erase the $13.9 trillion U.S. debt.”</p><p>The
 idea that the rest of us are personally liable for some portion of the 
national debt is preposterous. The truth is, the entire national debt 
could be paid off tomorrow, and none of us would have to chip in a dime.</p><p>That’s not how most economists see it.</p><p>Some
 do, however, argue that faster growth would help us deal with our “debt
 problem” because the problem is really the ratio of debt to the size or
 our economy. The trick, then, is to keep the debt ratio from heading 
north in perpetuity. For decades, conventional thinking held that the 
U.S. debt was on an unsustainable path because the formal models used to
 evaluate the debt trajectory all showed the ratio rising steadily 
higher into the indefinite future.</p><p>Today, some of the most 
influential economists in the world are telling us the debt might be 
sustainable after all, at least for now. For example, in January 2019, 
Olivier Blanchard, the former chief economist of the International 
Monetary Fund, made this the focus of his presidential address at the 
annual meeting of the American Economic Association. Blanchard explained
 that the debt trajectories for many countries, including the United 
States, appear to be on a sustainable path, at least in the near term. 
That’s because Blanchard expects interest on the debt to remain below 
the economy’s growth rate, which ensures that the debt ratio will not 
head off to infinity.</p><p>Blanchard argues we’re safe until financial 
markets push the interest rate above our economy’s growth rate, putting 
us right back on an unsustainable debt trajectory unless the budget has 
moved into surplus in the interim. Until then, we can relax and perhaps 
even safely increase the size of the fiscal deficit.</p>

    <div class="small-11 small-centered medium-11 medium-centered large-6 large-centered columns">
      <p>These were important findings, but it should be pointed out 
that economist Scott Fullwiler (University of Missouri—Kansas City) made
 a similar observation 13 years earlier. The difference is that 
Fullwiler looks at debt sustainability through the MMT lens. Blanchard’s
 more cautious take on sustainability rests on the possibility that 
interest rates could eventually jump higher, leading to the kind of debt
 crisis that unfolded in Greece or Argentina. But the U.S. is not like 
Greece (which borrows in euros) or Argentina (which defaulted on U.S. 
dollar-denominated debt). It can’t lose control of its interest rate.</p><p>This
 is a critically important insight that distinguishes the MMT 
perspective on debt sustainability from more conventional thinking. 
Under MMT, it is inflation — not the relationship between interest rates
 and growth rates — that matters. Still, it’s easy enough for the U.S. 
(and other monetary sovereigns) to satisfy the conventional criteria for
 sustainability.</p><p>Just look at Japan. At 240 percent, Japan’s 
debt-to-GDP ratio is the highest in the developed world. Imagine the 
horror Senator Enzi would experience at the thought of more than a 
quadrillion (yen) in debt. That’s a lot of zeroes! But Japan, like the 
U.S., is fine, at least when it comes to debt sustainability, because 
it’s a currency-issuing government with a central bank that can clear 
every payment obligation that comes due. Financial markets can’t push 
Japan into crisis because the Bank of Japan (BOJ) can override any 
unwanted move in interest rates. It could also, essentially, retire the 
entire debt using nothing more than a computer keyboard at the BOJ.</p><p>Most
 of the world’s leading central banks focus on setting just one interest
 rate — a very short-term interest rate known as the overnight rate. 
They rigidly fix this rate and then allow longer-term rates to reflect 
market sentiment about the expected future path of the short-term 
policy-determined rate. That leaves investors with some influence over 
the interest rate that the U.S. government pays on Treasuries. But — and
 this is really important — the government can always strip markets of 
any influence over the interest rate on government bonds. Indeed, that’s
 exactly what the Fed did during and immediately after World War II, and
 it’s what the BOJ is doing today.</p><p>To keep a lid on interest 
rates, the Fed formally committed to maintaining a low-interest- rate 
peg of 0.375 percent on short-term Treasury bills and implicitly capped 
the rate First Quarter 2021 93 on long-term Treasury bonds at 2.5 
percent. Even as deficits exploded and the national debt climbed from 
$79 billion in 1942 to $260 billion by the time the war ended in 1945, 
the federal government paid just 2.5 percent interest on long-term 
bonds. To hold rates at 2.5 percent, the Fed simply had to buy large 
quantities of U.S. Treasuries.</p><p>This required an open-ended 
commitment by the Fed, but it was an easy commitment to fulfill since 
the Fed purchases bonds simply by crediting the seller’s account with 
reserves. Coordination with fiscal policy officially ended in 1951, with
 an agreement known as the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord, which freed 
the Fed to pursue independent monetary policy.</p>

      <p>For more than three years, the Bank of Japan has been engaged 
in a policy known as yield curve control. In addition to anchoring the 
short-term interest rate, the BOJ committed to pinning rates on ten-year
 government bonds near zero. In carrying out that policy, the BOJ has 
purchased massive amounts of government debt, buying up ¥6.9 trillion in
 June 2019 alone.</p><p>As a result, the BOJ now holds roughly 50 
percent of all Japanese government bonds. So half of its debt has 
already been essentially retired. And the BOJ could easily go all the 
way to 100 percent. Overnight.</p><p>To some, this might seem 
preposterous. How can the BOJ manufacture ¥500 trillion out of thin air 
to buy back the rest of the debt without devastating inflationary 
consequences? Most economists are trained to accept some version of the 
quantity theory of money. Strict adherents, such as followers of Milton 
Friedman, will likely scream, “Zimbabwe!” “Weimar!” or “Venezuela!”</p><p>Economist
 Eric Lonergan, a hedge fund manager in London, knows better. He 
correctly observes that swapping government bonds for cash has no effect
 on the private sector’s net wealth.</p><p>While net wealth is 
unaffected, buying the bonds does have an effect on income. When the BOJ
 replaces bonds with cash, the private sector loses out on any interest 
that would have been paid. So, retiring the debt siphons interest income
 out of the private sector. With this in mind, Lonergan asks, “Why on 
earth would the Japanese household sector rush out and buy things when 
their interest income has fallen, their wealth is unchanged, and they 
are used to falling prices?”</p><p>The short answer is, they wouldn’t. 
If anything, transferring all of the outstanding government debt to the 
central bank’s balance sheet would tend to push prices lower, not 
higher. I would think twice about stripping the private sector of all of
 its interest-bearing government bonds at once, but the Japanese 
government could certainly pull it off. The U.S. could do it, too.</p>

think of it. No one comparing Uncle Sam to a spendthrift who’s running 
up the credit card and borrowing from China. No fear of losing access to
 the bond market and being forced into default like Greece. No 
economists arguing about whether interest rates will be low enough to 
keep the debt on a sustainable path. And best of all, no more stress 
about how to cover “your share” of the national debt.</p><p>We actually 
did it once. It was 1835, and it was the only time in U.S. history when 
the public debt was paid all the way down. That was long before the Fed 
was created, so the debt wasn’t gobbled out of existence by the central 
bank. It happened because the government ran fiscal surpluses from 1823 
to 1836. As bonds matured, the government simply paid them off.</p><p>By
 1835, the U.S. was debt-free. It was also headed for one of the worst 
economic downturns the country has ever experienced. Fiscal surpluses 
suck money out of the economy. Fiscal deficits do the opposite. As long 
as they’re not excessive, deficits can help to maintain a good economy 
by supporting incomes, sales and profits. They’re not imperative, but if
 they disappear for too long, eventually the economy hits a wall.</p><p>Each
 and every time the government substantially reduced the national debt, 
the economy fell into depression. Could it have been a remarkable 
coincidence? As we see from MMT, government surpluses shift deficits 
onto the non-government sector. Eventually, the private sector reaches 
the point where it can’t handle the debt. When that happens, spending 
grinds sharply lower and the economy falls into depression.</p><p>The 
U.S. experienced one brief period of sustained fiscal surpluses 
relatively recently. It happened during Bill Clinton’s presidency, and 
many Democrats still look back on it as a crowning achievement. The 
surpluses began in 1998, and by 1999 the White House was ready to party 
like it was, well, 1999.</p><p>The White House was preparing to feature 
the news in its annual Economic Report of the President. But instead of 
shouting it from the rooftops, White House officials quietly tucked it 
away. They were worried about the broader implications of wiping out the
 entire U.S. Treasury market. It was a return to the love-hate 
relationship many public officials have with the national debt. On the 
one hand, the White House would have loved to eliminate the national 
debt. On the other, it couldn’t risk getting rid of all Treasuries.</p>

      <p>What worried policymakers the most was the prospect of 
depriving the Federal Reserve of the key instrument it relied on to 
conduct monetary policy — government debt. When the Fed wanted to raise 
interest rates, it sold some of its Treasuries. Buyers paid for those 
bonds using a portion of their bank reserves. By removing enough 
reserves, the Fed could move the interest rate up. To cut rates, the Fed
 would do the opposite.</p><p>But the Great Recession changed the way 
the Fed conducts monetary policy, proving Treasuries were not a crucial 
tool. In November 2008, the Fed launched the first of three rounds of a 
massive bond-buying program called quantitative easing. By the time it 
was over, the Fed had gobbled up some $4.5 trillion in bonds. In 
addition to using quantitative easing to push longer-term interest rates
 lower, the Fed also changed the way it managed its short-term interest 
rate. Instead of buying and selling Treasuries to add and subtract 
reserves, the Fed simply started paying interest on reserve balances. 
Today, the Fed can adjust the short-term interest rate simply by 
announcing that it will pay a new rate.</p><p align="center">• • •</p><p>Times
 have changed. Taxes aren’t important because they help the government 
pay the bills. They’re important because they help to prevent government
 spending from creating an inflation problem. Similarly, bond sales 
aren’t important because they allow the government to finance fiscal 
deficits.</p><p>If we really want to make the national debt disappear, 
the most straightforward option is to simply let the central bank buy up
 government bonds in exchange for bank reserves. The thing we call the 
national debt is nothing more than a footprint from the past. What 
matters is not the size of the debt (or who holds it) but whether we can
 look back with pride, knowing that our stockpile of Treasuries exists 
because of the many (mostly) positive interventions that were taken on 
behalf of our democracy.</p>
