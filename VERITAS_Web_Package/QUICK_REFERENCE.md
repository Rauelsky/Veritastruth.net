## ❓ ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS

**Q: "How do you determine ratings?"**
A: "Transparent methodology based on 7 criteria: source credibility, evidence quality, logical reasoning, presentation balance, epistemological integrity, transparency, and limitation acknowledgment. Each rated independently, then combined."

**Q: "Isn't this biased toward mainstream sources?"**
A: "Look at National Debt - Heritage Foundation scores +6. We assess methodology, not source ideology. Alternative viewpoints score high when well-evidenced."

**Q: "What about fact-checking bias?"**
A: "VERITAS isn't binary fact-checking. We use a confidence scale acknowledging uncertainty. See the Gender Identity assessments - we show multiple legitimate perspectives."

**Q: "How do you scale this?"**
A: "Hybrid AI-first model with expert auditors. AI does initial assessment (~$25), expert validates (~$50-100). Quality maintained, costs reduced 10x from all-human model."

**Q: "What's your funding need?"**
A: "Seeking $2-3M for:
- Platform development (6-8 months)
- Expert network building
- Initial assessment library (1000+ articles)
- Public launch Q4 2026"
